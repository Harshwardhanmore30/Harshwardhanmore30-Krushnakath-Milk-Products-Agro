## 📌 Overview

This project leverages data science to optimize operations at **Krushnakath Milk Products & Agro**, a dairy and agro-based enterprise. The goal is to harness historical data to make informed decisions in:

- Demand forecasting
- Inventory and supply chain optimization
- Quality monitoring of milk products
- Seasonal sales and production analysis
- Business performance reporting

Using Python, machine learning, and visualization tools, we aim to reduce waste, improve prediction accuracy, and enhance strategic planning.

## 🧾 Objectives

- ✅ Clean and preprocess raw dairy/agro product data
- ✅ Visualize trends in sales, production, and seasonal demand
- ✅ Build machine learning models for demand prediction
- ✅ Cluster customers or suppliers based on behavior/volume
- ✅ Provide actionable insights for Krushnakath’s business decisions

## 📊 Data Description

The dataset includes:

- 🐄 **Milk Production Data**: Date-wise milk quantity, quality, fat content
- 🧊 **Inventory Data**: Milk stock levels, spoilage rate, cold storage logs
- 💰 **Sales Data**: Product type, quantity sold, region, time period
- 🌦 **External Factors**: Weather, festivals, or local demand shifts (if available)

*Note: Data used is anonymized and secure.*

## 📈 Modeling Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend analysis
   - Correlation matrix
   - Product and seasonality analysis

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value handling
   - Feature engineering (e.g., lag features, moving averages)
   - Scaling and encoding

3. **Modeling**
   - Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet)
   - Regression Models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - Clustering (KMeans) for customer segmentation

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - RMSE, MAE for forecasts
   - R² score
   - Silhouette score for clustering
